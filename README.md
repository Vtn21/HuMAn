## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
The main inspiration for developing this algorithm is *exoskeleton transparency control*, which aims at achieving synchronization and synergy between the motions of the exoskeleton robot and the human user. By being able to predict future motions from a previous time sequence, HuMAn can provide anticipation to a chosen control strategy.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
<!-- See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. -->

### üõ† Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

This algorithm is programmed using [Python](https://www.python.org/), currently using version 3.8. Installing Python through [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) üêç is recommended because:

- You gain access to [Conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/repo) packages, apart from [Pip](https://pypi.org/) packages;
- Conda is a great tool for managing virtual environments (you can [create](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) one to install all the prerequisites for HuMAn)!

Other key dependencies are (version numbers are kept for reference, but newer versions may work):

- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) (2.4)
```
pip install tensorflow
```

- [NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) (11.0)
  - This is not mandatory, but highly recommended! An available NVIDIA GPU can speed up TensorFlow code to a great extent, when compared to running solely on CPU;
  - You can install it with Conda, enabling different versions of the toolkit to be installed in other virtual environments;
  - Ensure to pair TensorFlow and CUDA versions correctly (see [this](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu#software_requirements)).
```
conda install cudatoolkit
```

### üíª Installing

This (still) is as simple as cloning this repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/Vtn21/HuMAn
```

<!-- End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo. -->

<!-- ## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a> -->
